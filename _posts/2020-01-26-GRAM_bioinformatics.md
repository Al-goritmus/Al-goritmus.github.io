With GRAM that is the spanish acronym for Manizales Antibiotic Resistance Group, its been all about academy, I'm a founder member of the group, we started it as an academic association for medical students and graduates in order to spread knowledge about bacterial resistance, microbiology subjects and later on created an epidemiological surveillance project for bacterial resistance in the city, that involved data analysis, interpeting antibiogram data at a comunity level and determining level of resistance for various multi drug resistent bacteria in Manizales, Colombia. Right now i'm a python programmer with knowledge of python data analysis libraries, that has allowed me to have a positive impact on analyzing genomic data obtained from tuberculosis culture strains and help in the development of bioinformatics projects.

Here we have some initial data analysis that we do on bacterial resistance datasets obtained after genome sequencing of tuberculosis bacteria from patients in Caldas, Colombia. Right now we are working in processing datasets to find correlations between genes and resistance patterns
