With GRAM, that is the spanish acronym for Manizales Antibiotic Resistance Group, its been all about academy, I'm a founder member of the group, with Sebastian Hernandez microbiology teacher, mentor and GRAM director since them, we started it in 2016 as an academic association for medical students and graduates in order to spread knowledge about bacterial resistance, microbiology subjects and later on, created an epidemiological surveillance project for bacterial resistance in the city, that involved data analysis, interpeting antibiogram data at a comunity level and determining level of resistance for various multi drug resistent bacteria in Manizales, Colombia. Right now  as a python programmer with knowledge of python data analysis libraries, I've been hable to have a positive impact on analyzing genomic data obtained from tuberculosis culture strains and help in the development of bioinformatics projects.

Here we have some initial data analysis that I do on bacterial resistance datasets obtained after genome sequencing of tuberculosis bacteria from patients in Caldas, Colombia. Right now we are working in processing datasets to find correlations between genes and resistance patterns, it involves from a bioinformatics perspective, to identify correlations between the presence of certain mutations and the phenotipic appearance of bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics, for me this is not a job, rather a long term collaboration project that started with me as a medicine student with interest on infections and now 7 years later is a scientific association that provides insights to his local community and advices doctors on which drugs to use, we also had a huge impact on 2020 COVID first and second waves response, since we as a group where the academic leaders on preparing thousands of doctos with medical evidence and data analysis insights for preparing for the pandemics and worked as counselors in local government decisitions.
