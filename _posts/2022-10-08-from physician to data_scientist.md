My name is Juli√°n Mendoza, I'm from colombia, studied medicine from 2012 to 2019, then worked as a doctor for a year but soon enough after graduating, I started to study math like crazy, mainly algebra and calculus, because I wanted to become an expert in AI but I knew that was gonna take a lot of time, and the process of first re learn math, then learn one or several programming languages and then become a data scientist and maybe later a machine learning enginer, so far the process involved first becoming a data analyst, then working as a data engineer, right now becoming a Jr. 

Data scientist and maybe a couple of years from now, I'll be able to lead AI complex projects in order to apply them to medicine, one of my most persistent dreams has been to work in diagnostic and prognostic AI someday in the future, but that's probably gonna have to wait right know, in the mean time I keep learning AI in coursera and other sources, algoritmus it's because my alter ego in videogames and Linux coding context has that nickname, a way of honoring Al-Juarismi father of algebra and algorithimics, its also his name translation in latin.

I'm currently studying machine learing algorithms in a much deeper way than before, including learning the code behind libraries like scikit-learn and tensor flow in order to have a much greater way to understand how to implement and perfectionate learning algorithms

I've always had a huge interest in science, mainly in neuroscience and everything that has to do with information processing in matter, that being said: information theory by Claude Shannon and Max tegmarks information realism are important prismas for me. Here are some previous papers in neuroscience:

I'ven working on data mining and data engineering for the past year, it's been a ride and a great adventure for me since it allowed me to better understand the importance of data quality, data warehousing and data transform in order to prepare for machine learning projects.  Most of the time I worked on ETL with DAGs in Apache Airflow, extraction and transform with Apache Spark, AWS, Azure and univariate analysis but I also had time to implement basic linear and logistic regression algorithms.
