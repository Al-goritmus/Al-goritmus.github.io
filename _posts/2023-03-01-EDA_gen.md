The automatized EDA generator python code is a very cool project that I worked with 2 engineers from IA Aplicada, our first goal to be honest, was to save a lot of time in generating data exploratory analysis notebooks for every file that we had to analyse and to have more time to investigate with a deeper view the correlations between data. With the coordination on Rafael Belalcazar as a senior and colaboration of Juan Manuel Davila, a great coleague, we managed to create a python code that uses the jupyter json cell structure to automatize the creation of EDA colab notebooks and saved us a lot of time, since this code reads a folder and generate a complete and adjusted EDA file with data analysis functions and graph generating cells for each column acording to data type using algorithms written in python to decide which functions to implement acording to data type.

Heres the Git-hub link to the code and next I let you some captures of the code structure, once you run it, it creates EDA notebooks for every excel or csv that you let inside the drive folder that holds the EDA generator notebook, it was in fact a Great idea.

Here's a part of the EDA generator where it adds some new cells to the generated notebook of the EDA ipynb file for object columns in the dataframe
