## Segmentation project using clustering and PCA

### This project aims to segmentate clients using K-means for clustering, then PCA for feature importances



### main_functions.

1)KNN imputer

2)K-means algorithm 

3)Elbow method for determining optimal number of clusters

4)Clustering for 3 most optimal n of clusters

5)Metrics using Silhouette score and WCSS

7)PCA for finding feature importances

#### note: 
automatically generated EDA files are uploaded but can't be read as normally in Github because Colab and github use different
notation for the json metadata of the notebook, specifically Github uses:"execution_count": null  and Colab uses "execution_count": 'null',  but these files are meant to be used in colab, So, I'm just gonna leave one of the EDA's shared from colab in order for you to be able to watch the final product.
